Welcome to my profile

## About
I'm a full-time Web/Data/Engineer/Student currently in DTU. I'm a certified AWS Architect, and I love messing around with stuff on the web. I also like to research various DL/ML topics and develop useless things in my free time.
I also break things (occasionally).

Most of my open-sourced projects are public on my Github.

> I'm Currently learning WASM, Rust and Web Security testing!
